# Rasberry pico digital clock & thermometer

I recently bought a cheap clock + thermometer from a store.
It looks quite nice, but only works ~12h on 3xAA battery and the thermometer is wildly innacurate.
Good excuse to replace the internals with something made myself!

Hardware:

- Rasberry Pico W
- DS3231 RTC (clock)
- AM2320 Temperature & Humidity sensor
- CN3065 BNC + Li-on 18650 battery
- Shell + LED matrix from ["Blokker Stella"](https://www.blokker.nl/blokker-wekker-stella---15x8x9-cm/2385214.html)
  clock

Software:

- Microptyon
- NTP for time
